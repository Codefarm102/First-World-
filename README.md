Hello People, 

Many Say Programmers are all a bunch of nerds who stay gluedd to their Laptop every second. I am here to differ that description and think Programmers are also people. Like anyother person enjoying movies, dancing, singing or eating, so are programmers. What am I saying, Programming has a lot of fun, that's why I love it.
